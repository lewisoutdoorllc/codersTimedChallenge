I built this timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals so as to provide a way to guage my progress compared to my peers. This quiz allows my peers and I the opportunity to take a 5 question timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals and give us our score at the end. Score is based on the time left and if you miss a question it is marked as wrong and will deduct 10 seconds for each wrong answer. Each question you answer before the quiz automaticlly goes to the next question it will tell you at the bottom of the page with a promt of wrong or correct. At the end of the quiz you will be prompted to enter your initials and then when submitted will put you on a score list. You can then keep track of the scores so at the end to see who did the best; once done all the scores can be deleted and you can start all over.

## JavaScript Changes

JavaScrpit was madeup to provide an interative and timed 5 question quiz with the ability to check answers for right and wrong while also deducting time for wrong answers and moving to the next question. At the end of the quiz it stores scores and user information for recall and also allows the information to be deleted when called for.
